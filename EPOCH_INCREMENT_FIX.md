# Era stamp incremental repair

## 🚀 Question description

In the `loginUser` function, the epoch stamp (epoch) is not incremented at the beginning of the login, which can cause race condition issues.

### **Original question code**
```javascript
async function loginUser(user) {
    console.log('=== User login ===');
    console.log('Login user information:', user);
    
    // 🚀 Save the current era stamp for subsequent inspection
    const myEpoch = authEpoch; // ❌ Not incremented, may cause race conditions
    console.log('Login process starts, era stamp:', myEpoch);
    // ...
}
```

### **Problem Analysis**
1. **Risk of Race Conditions**: If the user clicks to log in quickly and repeatedly, multiple login processes may use the same era stamp
2. **Old process not cancelled**: The await process that has not been completed before will not be automatically cancelled
3. **Border situation**: Unexpected behavior may occur in concurrent login scenarios

## 🔧 Solution

### **Fixed code**
```javascript
async function loginUser(user) {
    console.log('=== User login ===');
    console.log('Login user information:', user);
    
    // 🚀 Save the current era stamp for subsequent inspection
    const myEpoch = ++authEpoch; // ✅ Incremental era stamp, opening a new generation of process
    console.log('Login process starts, era stamp:', myEpoch);
    // ...
}
```

### **Repair principle**
1. **Automatic cancellation mechanism**: `++authEpoch` will immediately increment the global era poke
2. **Old process fails**: All await processes using old era pokes will automatically stop at the checkpoint
3. **Prevent competition**: Ensure that only the latest login process can be completed

## 📊 Repair effect

### **Prepared to repair**
- ❌ Fast repeated login may lead to race conditions
- ❌ The old login process will not be automatically cancelled
- ❌ Possible boundary situations where data inconsistencies occur

### **Fixed**
- ✅ Every time you log in, a new era will be opened
- ✅ The old login process will be automatically cancelled
- ✅ Prevent race conditions caused by fast repeat clicks
- ✅ Make sure only the latest login process can be completed

## 📝 Summary

By incrementing the era stamp at the beginning of the login, we achieve:

1. **Automatic cancellation mechanism**: The old login process will be automatically cancelled
2. **Racing Condition Protection**: Avoid problems caused by rapid repeated operations
3. **Data consistency**: Ensure that only the latest login process can be completed
4. **Border situation handling**: Stick in each critical checkpoint verification era

This fix ensures the robustness and reliability of the login process.
