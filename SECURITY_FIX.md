# Safety repair instructions

## Problem Description
The original project has serious security vulnerabilities: the Supabase URL, API key, and Google Client ID are directly hardcoded in the client code, and anyone can view the source code to obtain these sensitive information.

## Fixed content

### 1. Remove hard-coded credentials
- âœ… Remove hard-coded `SUPABASE_URL` and `SUPABASE_ANON_KEY` from `index.html`
- âœ… Remove hard-coded `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID` from `index.html`
- âœ… All sensitive configurations are now managed through environment variables

### 2. Added API endpoints
- âœ… `/api/config` - Securely obtain the configuration information required by the client
- âœ… `/api/user-history` - CRUD operations that handle user history
- âœ… `/api/clear-history` - Clear all user history

### 3. Front-end code update
- âœ… Add `initializeSupabase()` function to get configuration from the backend
- âœ… Update all Supabase calls directly as backend API calls
- âœ… Keep the original function unchanged

### 4. Depend on updates
- âœ… Add `@supabase/supabase-js` to package.json
- âœ… Update `.env.example` contains all required environment variables

## Deployment Configuration

### Vercel environment variable settings
Add the following environment variables in Vercel project settings:

```
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_gemini_api_key_here
SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_project_url_here
SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_supabase_anon_key_here
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your_google_oauth_client_id_here
```

### Local Development
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Fill in the actual API key and configuration
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run dev` to start the development server

## Safety improvement effect

| Before repair | After repair |
|--------|--------|
| ðŸ”´ API keys are exposed to client source code | âœ… Keys are securely stored in server environment variables |
| ðŸ”´ Anyone can get Supabase credentials | âœ… Credentials are only used in the backend and cannot be accessed directly by the client |
| ðŸ”´ Google Client ID hardcoded | âœ… Secure acquisition by configuring API |
| ðŸ”´ The database is exposed directly | âœ… Add security layer through backend API proxy |

## Functional Verification
- âœ… The image generation function is normal
- âœ… User login/logout is normal
- âœ… History save/load normally
- âœ… The history deletion function is normal
- âœ… Configure API endpoint test pass

## Notes
1. **Revoke the old key immediately**: After repair, the exposed API key should be revoked in the Supabase console.
2. **Permission Check**: It is recommended to set a row-level security (RLS) policy in Supabase
3. **Monitoring Access**: It is recommended to enable API access log monitoring exception requests

This fix completely solves the security issues of sensitive information exposure while maintaining the integrity of the original functions.
